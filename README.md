# A Scala RSS Reader Library

The purpose of this project is to provide a little library for reading RSS feeds
from Scala applications. Because an RSS feed is just XML, this library uses Scala’s
XML parsing library (which is now a standalone library). It also uses the ScalaJ
library if you want to use it to read an RSS feed URL.

Of course if you don’t like the code as is, feel free to just use this library as
a “demo” that shows what you have to do to read an RSS feed.
